# Add two primary users to bhopal group named newmarket and city. 
# Newmarket user can access the data of palasia user in rwx mode. 
# Add two primary users to group indore named rnt & palasia. 
# RNT can access the data of city user in read only. 
# Palasia user can access the data of new market user with full permission. 
# City user does not have interactive shell. Password of all user should be redhat.
